If you want to help us - choose your path:

## I'm a tech savvy person and I want to make something myself
Great! Feel free to fork this repo and add your improvements!
Pull requests will never go unnoticed.

#### Pull request requirements
- Commits which include one of the following files will **not** be accepted. Contact repo owner to discuss whatever you want to change in that file.
    - games/TriviaDeath2/TriviaDeath2.swf
    - games/TriviaDeath2/*.bank
- Commits including SWF files need to have extensive description of what has been modified. Since SWF is considered to be a binary file (hence no way to see the diff), commits may get rejected.
- JET files in your commits must be properly indented. There are no specific guidelines for the indentation style (i.e. no difference between spaces and tabs), but try to be consistant with your choice within a single JET file.
- Other commits will be manually reviewed and merged if deemed as non-breaking.
